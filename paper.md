# Summary

The emergence of low-field MRI presents a cost-effective and portable solution in magnetic resonance imaging [@oreilly:2021; @cooley:2020; @wald:2020; guallart-naval:2023]. Especially for portable imaging applications, the employment of advanced approaches, such as EMI suppression @liu:2021 and elaborate reconstruction models for B0 inhomogeneity corrections, has yielded substantial improvements in image fidelity [@schote:2022; @schote:2023; @koolstra:2021]. The domain is currently experiencing swift progress, particularly in the integration of auxiliary sensors @srinivas:2023 and the dynamic optimization of imaging parameters through feedback loop analytics @loktyushin:2021. Nonetheless, most available MRI consoles are not inherently designed to facilitate these complex techniques @negnevitsky:2023 or their proprietary nature poses limitations on customizability (e.g. limited on-board computing power, extension modules, or number of analog input/output channels). Our novel approach aims to bridge this gap and by providing a versatile, yet powerful console that enables a simple implementation of sophisticated methodologies and is easy to customize. It serves not only as a console but also as a high-performance reconstruction system enabling real-time data processing steps. It is tailored for advanced techniques and has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of low-field MRI systems, propelling the imaging performance beyond its current limits.

# Statement of need

The presented MR console was successfully implemented and tested on a low-field MRI scanner. The Python-based open-source implementation of the console software, along with the integration of Pulseq compatibility is publicly available and facilitates broad and straightforward adoption across the community for a multitude of applications.
In the current setup, gradient waveforms are replayed through the analog transmission channels capable of driving the GPA directly. Nonetheless, it is also feasible to dispatch these waveforms through the synchronous GPIO channels what would liberate three analog transmission channels. Moreover, the system's ability to synchronize up to eight measurement cards simplifies the expansion to even more transmit and receive channels as necessitated by more demanding applications, like B0-field supervision, noise-cancelling or GIRF based trajectory corrections.
The utilized cards enable direct data streaming to GPU memory, which paves the way for rapid AI-driven image reconstruction techniques and the potential to implement real-time adaptive feedback systems. This could significantly optimize both the sequence execution and the performance of external hardware components, which potentially enhances the image quality and the diagnostic value. Furthermore, the implementation facilitates effortless integration with the web-based acquisition control platform, ScanHub @schote-scanhub:2023.
