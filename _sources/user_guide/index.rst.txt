User Guide
==========

Welcome to the Spectrum-Console user guide.
This guide explains some of the key-concepts of the package and gives some general information about the setup.
The concept guide contains more general information independent of the implementation.
We aim to provide a transparent documentation in order to enable developers to understand design decisions, familiarize quickly and be able to further improve the package.
If you find anything incomprehensible or have suggestions for improvements, please contact me.

The first section of the user guide gives an overview of the overall system setup.
It might be different to your specific setup but in general it should be transferable.
In the subsequent chapter we have a closer look at the overall system architecture, before 
we explain the key concepts of sequence handling and execution.
