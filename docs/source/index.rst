Spectrum-Console
================
Fully Digital Open-Source Console for MRI Acquisitions Written in Python
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the documentation for the Spectrum Consoleâ€”an open-source MRI console 
designed for low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
This console, driven by Spectrum-Instrumentation measurement cards and Python-based software, 
offers a cost-effective and portable solution for exploring sophisticated low-field imaging techniques. 
Successfully implemented and tested on a low-field MRI scanner, 
the Spectrum-Console demonstrates real-time computed Pulseq sequences 
with high fidelity compared to measured waveforms. 
The console's design holds the potential to enhance the capabilities of low-field MRI systems, fostering opportunities for advanced techniques in the field.
Explore the documentation to delve into the technical details and possibilities offered by the Spectrum-Console.
The documentation provides insights, including quick-start guide, user guide, hands-on examples and the API reference.
